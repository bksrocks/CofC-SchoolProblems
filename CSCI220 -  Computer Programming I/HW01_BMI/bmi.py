# Name: Barbara Szwabowski

# Purpose: compute and print a userâ€™s Body Mass Index (BMI), Ideal Body
# Weight (for male), Lean Body Weight (for female) and Body Surface Area
# (BSA). Computes BSA using three different formulas: Mosteller, DuBois
# & DuBois, and Boyd.

# Certification of Authenticity: I certify that this lab is entirely my
# own work.

# Input: User's weight(in kg) and height(in cm).

# Output: Values for user's computed Body Mass Index (BMI), Ideal Body
# Weight (for male), Lean Body Weight (for female),
# and Body Surface Area (BSA) - in Mosteller, DuBois & DuBois, and Boyd.

# Name: Barbara Szwabowski
# pi.py

# Purpose: Compute the number of pi using the Wallis product, the
# Gregory-Leibniz series, the Nilakantha Series and the Euler‚Äôs method,
# then see how those results compare to math.pi

# Certification of Authenticity: I certify that this lab is entirely my
# own work.

# Input: The number of terms to the approximation

# Output: The calculated pi and the approximation error for each of the
# calculations
